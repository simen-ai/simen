## Core Capabilities

- **Specialized Agents, Not Generalists**: Simen provides meticulously crafted agents like **Bonnie** for office automation and **Taylor** for econometrics. They are designed to be masters in their fields, delivering tangible outcomes for complex, real-world problems.
- **Automate Your Office Work**: Let Bonnie, your Python-powered office master, handle the tedious work. Automatically organize files, clean messy data, process huge Excel files, batch-format Word documents, and beautify PowerPoint presentations in minutes, not hours.
- **No-Code Econometrics**: Speak to Taylor to clean data, run statistical analyses, build regressions, and generate publication-ready tables and charts. Simen has built-in Stata to handle the heavy lifting, so you can focus on your research.
- **Continuously Evolving**: Our agents mirror higher education. They study extensive literature, learn from real-world case studies, and continuously synthesize their experience to improve.
- **Privacy by Design**: Your data security is paramount. Simen processes sensitive files locally on your machine, and all cloud communication is protected with end-to-end encryption. You have full control over your data.
- **Broad File Format Support**: Simen seamlessly works with the files you use every day, including Documents (`DOCX`, `PDF`, `TXT`, `MD`), Spreadsheets (`XLSX`, `CSV`), Presentations (`PPTX`), and specialized Stata formats (`DTA`, `DO`, `GPH`).
