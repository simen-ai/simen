## Core Capabilities

- **Specialized Agents, Not Generalists**: Simen provides meticulously crafted agents such as **Bonnie** for office automation, **Taylor** for econometrics, and **Jesse** for video production. They are designed to be experts in their respective fields, providing satisfactory solutions for complex and real-world industry problems.
- **Automate Your Office Work**: Let Bonnie (your Python-powered office expert) handle tedious tasks. Automatically organize files, clean messy data, process large Excel files, batch-format Word documents, and beautify PowerPoint presentations in minutes, not hours.
- **No-Code Econometrics**: Speak to Taylor to clean data, run statistical analyses, build regression models, and generate publication-ready tables and charts. Simen has built-in Stata to handle the heavy lifting, so you can focus on your research.
- **Automated Image Processing**: Jesse handles image processing tasks, automatically operating Photoshop and performing image processing according to your needs.
- **High-Gradient Growth**: Our agents mimic higher education. They study extensive literature, learn from real-world case studies, and continuously synthesize their experience to improve.
- **Privacy-First Design**: Your data security is paramount. Simen processes sensitive files locally on your machine, and all cloud communication is protected with end-to-end encryption. You have full control over your data.
- **Broad Local File Support**: Simen seamlessly works with the files you use every day, including Documents (`DOCX`, `PDF`, `TXT`, `MD`), Spreadsheets (`XLSX`, `CSV`), Presentations (`PPTX`), and specialized Stata formats (`DTA`, `DO`, `GPH`).
